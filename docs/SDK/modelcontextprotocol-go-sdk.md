# MCP Go SDK v0.2.0

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codespaces/badge.svg/refs/heads//)](https://codespaces.new/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

***BREAKING CHANGES***

This version contains breaking changes.
See the [release notes](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for details.

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)

This repository contains an unreleased implementation of the official Go
software development kit (SDK) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

> \[!WARNING]
> The SDK should be considered unreleased, and is currently unstable
> and subject to breaking changes. Please test it out and file bug reports or API
> proposals, but don't use it in real projects. See the issue tracker for known
> issues and missing features. We aim to release a stable version of the SDK in
> August, 2025.

## Design

The design doc for this SDK is at [design.md](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/tree/main/design/design.md), which was
initially reviewed at
[modelcontextprotocol/discussions/364](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/364).

Further design discussion should occur in
[issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues) (for concrete
proposals) or
[discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/discussions) for
open-ended discussion. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Package documentation

The SDK consists of three importable packages:

* The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp)
  package defines the primary APIs for constructing and using MCP clients and
  servers.
* The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonschema`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonschema)
  package provides an implementation of [JSON
  Schema](https://json-schema.org/), used for MCP tool input and output schema.
* The
  [`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/jsonrpc) package is for users implementing
  their own transports.

## Example

In this example, an MCP client communicates with an MCP server running in a
sidecar process:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"os/exec"

	"github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Create a new client, with no features.
	client := mcp.NewClient(&mcp.Implementation{Name: "mcp-client", Version: "v1.0.0"}, nil)

	// Connect to a server over stdin/stdout
	transport := &mcp.CommandTransport{Command: exec.Command("myserver")}
	session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Call a tool on the server.
	params := &mcp.CallToolParams{
		Name:      "greet",
		Arguments: map[string]any{"name": "you"},
	}
	res, err := session.CallTool(ctx, params)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("CallTool failed: %v", err)
	}
	if res.IsError {
		log.Fatal("tool failed")
	}
	for _, c := range res.Content {
		log.Print(c.(*mcp.TextContent).Text)
	}
}
```

Here's an example of the corresponding server component, which communicates
with its client over stdin/stdout:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp"
)

type HiParams struct {
	Name string `json:"name" jsonschema:"the name of the person to greet"`
}

func SayHi(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.ServerRequest[*mcp.CallToolParamsFor[HiParams]]) (*mcp.CallToolResultFor[any], error) {
	return &mcp.CallToolResultFor[any]{
		Content: []mcp.Content{&mcp.TextContent{Text: "Hi " + req.Params.Arguments.Name}},
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a server with a single tool.
	server := mcp.NewServer(&mcp.Implementation{Name: "greeter", Version: "v1.0.0"}, nil)

	mcp.AddTool(server, &mcp.Tool{Name: "greet", Description: "say hi"}, SayHi)
	// Run the server over stdin/stdout, until the client disconnects
	if err := server.Run(context.Background(), &mcp.StdioTransport{}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

The [`examples/`](https://github.com/examples/) directory contains more example clients and servers.

## Acknowledgements

Several existing Go MCP SDKs inspired the development and design of this
official SDK, notably [mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go), authored
by Ed Zynda. We are grateful to Ed as well as the other contributors to mcp-go,
and to authors and contributors of other SDKs such as
[mcp-golang](https://github.com/metoro-io/mcp-golang) and
[go-mcp](https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp). Thanks to their work, there
is a thriving ecosystem of Go MCP clients and servers.
