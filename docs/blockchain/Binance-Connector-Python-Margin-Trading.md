## Documentation

For detailed information, refer to the [Binance API Documentation](https://developers.binance.com/docs/margin_trading/Introduction).

### REST APIs

All REST API endpoints are available through the [`rest_api`](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/src/binance_sdk_margin_trading/rest_api/rest_api.py) module. The REST API enables you to fetch market data, manage trades, and access account information. Note that some endpoints require authentication using your Binance API credentials.

```python
from binance_common.configuration import ConfigurationRestAPI
from binance_common.constants import MARGIN_TRADING_REST_API_PROD_URL
from binance_sdk_margin_trading.margin_trading import MarginTrading
from binance_sdk_margin_trading.rest_api.models import GetSummaryOfMarginAccountResponse

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
configuration = ConfigurationRestAPI(api_key="your-api-key", api_secret="your-api-secret", base_path=MARGIN_TRADING_REST_API_PROD_URL)

client = MarginTrading(config_rest_api=configuration)

try:
    response = client.rest_api.get_summary_of_margin_account()

    data: GetSummaryOfMarginAccountResponse = response.data()
    logging.info(f"get_summary_of_margin_account() response: {data}")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"get_summary_of_margin_account() error: {e}")
```

More examples can be found in the [`examples/rest_api`](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/examples/rest_api/) folder.

#### Configuration Options

The REST API supports the following advanced configuration options:

- `timeout`: Timeout for requests in milliseconds (default: 1000 ms).
- `proxy`: Proxy configuration:
  - `host`: Proxy server hostname.
  - `port`: Proxy server port.
  - `protocol`: Proxy protocol (http or https).
  - `auth`: Proxy authentication credentials:
    - `username`: Proxy username.
    - `password`: Proxy password.
- `keep_alive`: Enable HTTP keep-alive (default: true).
- `compression`: Enable response compression (default: true).
- `retries`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3).
- `backoff`: Delay in milliseconds between retries (default: 1000 ms).
- `https_agent`: Custom HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configuration.
- `private_key`: RSA or ED25519 private key for authentication.
- `private_key_passphrase`: Passphrase for the private key, if encrypted.

##### Timeout

You can configure a timeout for requests in milliseconds. If the request exceeds the specified timeout, it will be aborted. See the [Timeout example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/timeout.md) for detailed usage.

##### Proxy

The REST API supports HTTP/HTTPS proxy configurations. See the [Proxy example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/proxy.md) for detailed usage.

##### Keep-Alive

Enable HTTP keep-alive for persistent connections. See the [Keep-Alive example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/keepAlive.md) for detailed usage.

##### Compression

Enable or disable response compression. See the [Compression example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/compression.md) for detailed usage.

##### Retries

Configure the number of retry attempts and delay in milliseconds between retries for failed requests. See the [Retries example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/retries.md) for detailed usage.

##### HTTPS Agent

Customize the HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configurations. See the [HTTPS Agent example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/httpsAgent.md) for detailed usage.

##### Key Pair Based Authentication

The REST API supports key pair-based authentication for secure communication. You can use `RSA` or `ED25519` keys for signing requests. See the [Key Pair Based Authentication example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/key-pair-authentication.md) for detailed usage.

##### Certificate Pinning

To enhance security, you can use certificate pinning with the `https_agent` option in the configuration. This ensures the client only communicates with servers using specific certificates. See the [Certificate Pinning example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/certificate-pinning.md) for detailed usage.

#### Error Handling

The REST API provides detailed error types to help you handle issues effectively:

- `ClientError`: Represents an error that occurred in the SDK client.
- `RequiredError`: Thrown when a required parameter is missing or undefined.
- `UnauthorizedError`: Indicates missing or invalid authentication credentials.
- `ForbiddenError`: Access to the requested resource is forbidden.
- `TooManyRequestsError`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `RateLimitBanError`: IP address banned for exceeding rate limits.
- `ServerError`: Internal server error, optionally includes a status code.
- `NetworkError`: Issues with network connectivity.
- `NotFoundError`: Resource not found.
- `BadRequestError`: Invalid request or one that cannot be served.

See the [Error Handling example](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/docs/rest_api/error-handling.md) for detailed usage.

If `base_path` is not provided, it defaults to `https://api.binance.com`.

### Websocket Streams

WebSocket Streams in margin-trading is used for subscribing to risk and trade data streams. Use the [websocket-streams](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/tree/master/clients/margin_trading/src/binance_sdk_margin_trading/websocket_streams/websocket_streams.py) module to interact with it.

#### Configuration Options

The WebSocket Streams API supports the following advanced configuration options:

- `reconnect_delay`: Delay (ms) between reconnections.
- `compression`: Enable response compression.
- `mode`: Choose between `single` and `pool` connection modes.
  - `single`: A single WebSocket connection.
  - `pool`: A pool of WebSocket connections.
- `pool_size`: Define the number of WebSocket connections in pool mode.
- `https_agent`: Custom HTTPS agent for advanced TLS configuration.
- `user_agent`: Custom user agent string for WebSocket Streams.

#### Subscribe to Risk and Trade Data Streams

You can consume the risk and trade data stream, which sends account-level events such as account and order updates. First create a listen-key via REST API; then:

```python
import asyncio
import logging

from binance_common.configuration import ConfigurationWebSocketStreams
from binance_common.constants import MARGIN_TRADING_WS_STREAMS_PROD_URL
from binance_sdk_margin_trading.margin_trading import MarginTrading

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

configuration_ws_streams = ConfigurationWebSocketStreams(
    reconnect_delay=5000,
)

client = MarginTrading(config_ws_streams=configuration_ws_streams)

connection = None
try:
    connection = await client.websocket_streams.create_connection()

    stream = await connection.tradeData(listenKey="listen-key")
    stream.on("message", lambda data: {
        match data["e"]:
            case "balanceUpdate":
                print(f"Risk level change stream: {data}")
            case 'outboundAccountPosition':
                print(f"outbound account position stream {data}");
                break;
            # …handle other variants…
            case _:
                print(f"Unknown stream: {data}")
    })
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in user data stream: {e}")
```

#### Unsubscribing from Streams

You can unsubscribe from specific WebSocket streams using the `unsubscribe` method. This is useful for managing active subscriptions without closing the connection.

```python
import asyncio
import logging

from binance_common.configuration import ConfigurationWebSocketStreams
from binance_sdk_margin_trading.margin_trading import MarginTrading

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = MarginTrading(config_ws_streams=ConfigurationWebSocketStreams())

try:
    connection = await client.websocket_streams.create_connection()
    stream = connection.tradeData(listenKey="listen-key")
    stream.on("message", lambda data: {
        match data["e"]:
            case "riskLevelChange":
                print(f"Risk level change stream: {data}")
            case _:
                print(f"Unknown stream: {data}")
    })
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await stream.unsubscribe()
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in user data stream: {e}")
finally:
    if connection:
        await connection.close_connection(close_session=True)
```

If `wsURL` is not provided, it defaults to `wss://stream.binance.com:9443`.

### Automatic Connection Renewal

The WebSocket connection is automatically renewed for both WebSocket API and WebSocket Streams connections, before the 24 hours expiration of the API key. This ensures continuous connectivity.
